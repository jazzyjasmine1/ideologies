If you want to work with the router, you need to configure a languages.json file first

Just add a bunch of domains that you can access the dev server on and it should work fine.

For example, if you want "domain1.local" to point to the "en" locale, and "domain2.local" to point to the "ja" locale,
put the following in languages.json

    {
        "domain1.local": "en",
        "domain2.local": "ja"
    }
